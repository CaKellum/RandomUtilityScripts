# Random Utility Scripts

If you want these you can have them 

to run them all you will need to do is
```Bash
[~] source <script>
```
**note**: I have the directory added to my path so they are available to me anywhere but just pu the path to the 
script in front of it if you dont want to edit your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`

I am not updating things based on your needs, you want changes fork it make it your own have fun
